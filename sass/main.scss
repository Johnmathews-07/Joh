 * What follows is the result of much research on cross-browser styling.
 * Credit left inline and big thanks to Nicolas Gallagher, Jonathan Neal,
 * Kroc Camen, and the H5BP dev community and team.
 * 
 * This file was built using the Sass, "Sassy CSS" Extension for CSS
 *   http://sass-lang.com/
 * This extension enhances CSS by adding in variables, mixins, nesting, interpolation,
 *   arguments, and more. In short, it makes CSS fun again.
