# crossdomain.xml

The _cross-domain policy file_ is an XML document that gives a web client —
such as Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader, etc. — permission to handle data
across multiple domains, by:

 * granting read access to data
 * permitting the client to include custom headers in cross-domain requests
 * granting permissions for socket-based connections

__e.g.__ If a client hosts content from a particular source domain and that
content makes requests directed towards a domain other than its own, the remote
domain would need to host a cross-domain policy file in order to grant access
to the source domain and allow the client to continue with the transaction.

For more in-depth information, please see Adobe's [cross-domain policy file
specification](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html).
